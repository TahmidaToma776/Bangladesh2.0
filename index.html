But I firmly believe that we, as individuals and as a society, have the ability to change the course of history. There is an enormous potential within each of us to make a difference. One of the most powerful tools we have to address these challenges is the concept of social business.Social business is a business that is driven not by profit maximization, but by the pursuit of social goals. It is a business where the primary objective is to solve a social problem—be it in health, education, the environment, or poverty alleviation—while remaining financially sustainable. This is the true potential of human ingenuity, to harness the power of enterprise to serve humanity"</p></li>
